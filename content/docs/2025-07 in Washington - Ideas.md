### Fishing Excursions
##### Fish in the Skagit River 
Many spots, some in North Cascades NP. 90-120 minutes from Coupeville.

"The season begins quietly on June 1st with a marginal run of summer steelhead. Spring chinook are a remnant run and fishing for salmon doesn't really pick up until late summer when pink salmon (in odd years) and silver salmon return to the river. Bull trout and sea-run cutthroat can be found on the tails of these fish feeding on the rich eggs and flesh left by the spawning salmon. Late fall brings the first of the chum salmon and hatchery winter steelhead. Chum salmon peak around Thanksgiving and the hatchery steelhead are most available in December and early January. The bull trout fishing continues to be good at this time of year as well." - [The Avid Angler](https://avidangler.com/fishing-conditions/water-profiles/rivers/skagit-river#:~:text=Species%20and%20Seasons-,The%20Skagit%20hosts%20runs%20of%20both%20summer%20and%20winter%20steelhead,large%20and%20numerous%20native%20steelhead.)

##### Salmon Fishing Charters
Puget Sound harbors five unique types of Salmon; the legendary King (Chinook), Red (Sockeye), Silver (Coho), Pink (Humpy) and Chum (Keta). The most prominent species in these waters is the King Salmon, which can be fished for nearly year round. The winter fishing targets the Blackmouth Salmon, an immature King that is on its way out to sea.

"Brook trout, cutthroat and some strains of rainbow are adaptable and prolific in their spawning habits, sometimes using springs to spawn in high lakes. Uncontrolled reproduction in high lakes can lead to overpopulation. Such trout lakes are characterized by dense populations of slow growing trout with large heads and skinny bodies. Essentially, they are eating themselves out of house and home.

WDFW allows for a more liberal harvest in some of these over-populated lakes and stocks  others with predator species to bring these populations under control. The agency encourages anglers to fish these lakes and has identified where over-populated lakes exist through the high lakes mapping tools. Anglers are strongly encouraged to seek out these lakes and remove the legal number of trout each day they fish. Reducing the over-abundance of trout in these lakes lessens the impact these populations are having on lake ecology and native aquatic fauna."
